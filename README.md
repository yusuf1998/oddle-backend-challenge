## General info
A simple weather checking API service.
	
## Technologies
* Java 1.8
* Spring Boot 2.4.3

## Setup
**Prerequisites:**

You need to update the database config to point to your desired database first.

**Run:**
```
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

## Weather API Provider

https://openweathermap.org/current
> Access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities! We collect and process weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and vast network of weather stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.

## Requirements
* The server should be written in Java Spring / Spring Boot and Hibernate. The client will consume RESTFUL APIs provided by the server.
* Follow coding best practices.
* Understanding of API Designs (both REST and GraphQL are accepted with no preference)
* Understanding  of Spring Boot framework
* Show considerations for Speed, Efficiency, and Scalability in your APIs and Database design and coding
* Show how existing functions can be tested efficiently when introducing new feature

## Notes
* Ensure that you understand the requirements of the assignment before continuing.
* Add in adequate comments to explain your codes. (If you need to write a documentation to explain your solution, please do so)
* Tell the consumer how to consume your API. Documentation is great, actual way to run your APIs are even greater.
* Design and attach your .sql file when you submit your project.
* If additional setup is required, please update README.md that explains the steps to get the assignment working.
* Think about how big the data can become and what to do about it
* Think about scaling your app. You do not need to implement it now.

## Submission Steps
* Fork the repository https://github.com/oddle-developer/oddle-backend-challenge to your machine
* Duplicate it to private repository on your Github account (https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)
* Code. Commit and Push as many times as you want, only the last Pull Request will be graded
* Create a Pull Request in your private repo and invite us as reviewer
* Add https://github.com/oddle-developer as collaborator for your repo and add `oddle-developer` as reviewer to your PR
